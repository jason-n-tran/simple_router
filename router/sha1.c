 *  Description:
 *      This file implements the Secure Hashing Standard as defined
 *      in FIPS PUB 180-1 published April 17, 1995.
 *
 *      The Secure Hashing Standard, which uses the Secure Hashing
 *      Algorithm (SHA), produces a 160-bit message digest for a
 *      given data stream.  In theory, it is highly improbable that
 *      two messages will produce the same message digest.  Therefore,
 *      this algorithm can serve as a means of providing a "fingerprint"
 *      for a message.
 *
 *  Portability Issues:
 *      SHA-1 is defined in terms of 32-bit "words".  This code was
 *      written with the expectation that the processor has at least
 *      a 32-bit machine word size.  If the machine word size is larger,
 *      the code should still function properly.  One caveat to that
 *      is that the input functions taking characters and character
 *      arrays assume that only 8 bits of information are stored in each
 *      character.
 *
 *  Caveats:
 *      SHA-1 is designed to work with messages less than 2^64 bits
 *      long. Although SHA-1 allows a message digest to be generated for
 *      messages of any number of bits less than 2^64, this
 *      implementation only works with messages with a length that is a
 *      multiple of the size of an 8-bit character.
